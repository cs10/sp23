I’m passionate about bringing engaging and powerful CS “big ideas” to students who normally wouldn’t be exposed to it. I am humbled by all the national attention BJC has received (see the “in the News” part of my website) and hope you find this class beautiful and joyful! When I’m not working, you can find me traveling, playing golf or board games (e.g., Monopoly Deal), or binging shows (anything Pixar or Marvel) with my family. p.s. My wife and I both went to Cal for grad school… Go Bears! . ",

Lecture introduces concepts and gives you and overview of what is happening in labs and discussions. | Lab Sections: Labs will be held synchronously and are the primary place you will learn to program. While lab attendance is not mandatory, you will need to attend lab or office hours to get credit for them. To earn full credit for a lab, it must be completed, submitted, and checked-off. Checkoff can be done synchronously either in lab or in office hours. If you have a special circumstance where you are unable to check-off a lab, you may ask for an extension using our extension form (see below). Each lab will be due by the end of the following lab day (labs assigned on Mon/Tue are due on Wed/Thu. Those assigned Wed/Thu are due on the next lab on Mon/Wed.) There will be 17 total labs — but only your top 15 lab scores will count towards your grade (i.e. you get two lab drops). Each lab is worth 2 points. Half a point will be deducted for each day that a lab is checked off late; however, a maximum of 1 point will be deducted for any given lab. You should plan on attending the lab you sign up for the entire term, but you may attend other lab sections or office hours to get checked off or get extra help. | Discussion Sections: Discussion sections are where you will delve into the content more deeply with worksheets in traditional “pen-and-paper” style. This is where you will develop the theoretical computational skills needed to understand the basics of programming. While we strongly encourage students to attend Discussions in-person, we will also post recordings for students who can not attend some sections. | Office Hours: During office hours, you can meet with a TA for help with course material, assignments, or bigger picture questions. | Instructor Office Hours: Professor Garcia will be holding Instructor OH which you may attend for more conceptual help or to discuss anything you like (e.g. career/major advice or how you’re doing in the class) within reason. | Projects: These assignments will be one of the best ways for you to apply what you have learned in lecture, lab and discussion. These will be a bit more time intensive than the other assignments and will require you to be caught up on the other components of the class. | Project Parties: These will serve as specialized office hours where you will be able to come work and get help on whatever project is currently assigned. We strongly encourage you to attend these as they will help you finish your assignments on time. | . ",

    "content": "Let’s get honest about being honest. It is truly a disappointment to catch students cheating. All we really want is for you to learn the material and if the class is stressful enough that you feel the need to cheat, we have failed as instructors. If you are feeling stressed out in the course, please tell us. We will do what we can to help you. Maintaining academic integrity is a crucial part of your learning experience, as cheating prevents us as instructors from understanding where our model of instruction isn’t working. We understand that academics can be stressful and that it might be tempting to cheat; however, there are ways to meet your goals that don’t require academically dishonest means. Here, we will lay out our academic integrity policies and some good practices that will help you avoid academic dishonesty and improve your overall mastery of the material. What constitutes cheating? . | Copying part or all of another student’s project code with the exception of your partner(s) assuming that the project you are working on allows for partnered work. This includes students from previous semesters (we still have their code and will know if you do this). | Sharing or receiving the exact steps used to solve a project problem (even if code is not explicitly sent). | Copying part or all of another student’s exam answers. | Collaborating with another student when taking the quest, midterm, or Post-term exams by receiving or giving assistance of any kind. | Copying code from online sources without crediting them | . What constitutes collaboration? . | Asking instead of telling. If you’re working with your friends and one of them is stuck on a part of an assignment, try to ask them guiding questions instead of telling them the answer. | Keeping things conceptual! It’s more beneficial to your learning if you come up with a solution yourself, rather than having it told to you. This also applies if you are helping someone else. We highly encourage collaboration, so let’s define what that means. Discussing approaches to problems is fine (in fact, we actively encourage it), as long as you eventually arrive at a good enough understanding of the problem that you are able to code the solution completely by yourself. You should not allow concerns about cheating to get in the way of discussing the class material with your classmates. It is okay if you have received some help with ideas along the way (but not a fully worked out solution).* *This policy was adapted from Professor Alistair Sinclair’s policy for CS 172. | . What happens if you cheat? We will set up a meeting with you to discuss the situation and determine the consequences. ",

Concretely, this means a few things: . | In addition to teaching the technical skills necessary for programming, we will also teach the social implications of computer science. In doing so, we will directly address the contributions of underrepresented groups to the field, which are often overlooked. | We will do our absolute best to show you that while bias, discrimination, and judgment still exist, they should not stand in the way of you learning computer science. While acknowledging the struggles many students may face, we also hope to show that computer science is a field anyone can be successful in (in other words, there is no innate “talent” or “trait” required to understand computer science). Of course, different people have different opportunities, but one of the goals of CS10 is to equalize the playing field. | Discrimination or disrespect on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, ability, gender, or sexual orientation will be tolerated under no circumstances.
