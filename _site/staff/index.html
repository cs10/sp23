I co-invented BJC in 2008 with my good friend and colleague Brian Harvey, and absolutely love teaching it. I’m passionate about bringing engaging and powerful CS “big ideas” to students who normally wouldn’t be exposed to it. I am humbled by all the national attention BJC has received (see the “in the News” part of my website) and hope you find this class beautiful and joyful! When I’m not working, you can find me traveling, playing golf or board games (e.g., Monopoly Deal), or binging shows (anything Pixar or Marvel) with my family. p.s. My wife and I both went to Cal for grad school… Go Bears!</p></div></div></div><h2 id="head-teaching-assistants"> <a href="#head-teaching-assistants" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="head-teaching-assistants"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Head Teaching Assistants</h2><div class="role"><div class="staffer"> <img class="staffer-image" src="/sp23/assets/images/imen.jpg" alt="" /><div><h3 class="staffer-name"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imenguechtouli/">Imen Guechtouli</a></h3><p><a href="mailto:imen@">imen@</a></p><p>Hey hey hey!!!

The class quickly became my favorite I’ve taken so far at Berkeley as it opened up the world of programming to me in a very beginner-friendly way.
