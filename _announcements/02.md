# **General Reminders**

- [Weekly-Blast 2](https://edstem.org/us/courses/35027/discussion/2427648) has been posted on Ed. Note that weekly blasts are **required readings** in CS10.
- Project 1 : Wordleâ„¢-lite has been released! You can reference Week 1 of the course calendar below to find the spec.
- We have started check offs for all labs as of Week 2. Please use the partner threads on Ed or talk to your Lab TA if you're struggling to find a partner.
- Please email cs10@ if you are a late add (added the course after Week 1) and/or if you don't have access to [Edstem](https://edstem.org/us/courses/35027) or [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/493934).
- The **add/drop deadline** is Wednesday, February 8th. All adds/drops **after this Friday, 1/27** will result in a add/drop fee, so do keep this in mind and talk to anyone on staff if you need any guidance regarding such a decision.
