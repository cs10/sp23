Hey! :) Iâ€™m currently a freshman studying CS and Data Science. This is my first time AI-ing for a class, so I am excited to be here. I started here last year with no coding experience (like actually, I didn't know how to open up a terminal LOL). However, this class was so supportive, and I was able to learn so much through it. I am by no means a master at CS, but this class made me see the fun there is in coding.
