Hi everyone! Iâ€™m Wen and I'm a freshman studying Pure Math, Computer Science, and Mechanical Engineering. This is my second semester of college and my first time AIing CS10! I took CS10 last semester and had tons of joy. I love eating and am a big fan of ketchup. I also like running marathons and watching soccer games. Can't wait to see all of you this semester:))))
