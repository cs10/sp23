Hello! I'm a first-year intended CS major, and this is my first time working as an AI for CS10! 
I began my programming journey as a high school sophomore, working for my local FIRST robotics team.  At Berkeley, I have developed an even greater appreciation for the field, and I look forward to helping others discover their passion for it too!
