Hello Everyone! Iâ€™m a sophomore studying CS and this is my third year working with CS10. Currently, I work as an intern at a software company, SAP. I'm also apart of Dan Garcia's research group, Gamescrafters. When I first took the course, I had no programming experience. I fell in love with it and became a BJC and Snap! evangelist. As a non-traditional student coming back to school at the age of 23, I believe anyone can learn CS, and CS is a field for everyone - no matter your age, skill level, or past performance.
