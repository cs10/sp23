Hello! My name is Jimmy, and  Iâ€™m a senior studying math. I took CS10 last semester. I have to say BJC is the class I enjoyed the most at Cal. I had no idea what programming was before I took this class. That's also why I had to use the late drop for my math 128A(numerical analysis) last year; However, I absolutely love programming now. In my free time, I am always trying to explore restaurants in the city (I am a big foodie). Feel free to reach me out for food spots or anything else!
