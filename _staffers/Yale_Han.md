Hey everyone! Iâ€™m a freshman studying computer science, and I'm excited to return to CS10 as an AI. As with many CS10 students, I started out with little prior experience, but this course helped to build my confidence and knowledge of CS. This is certainly a challenging course, but it *is* rewarding, and I hope to see everyone discover the 'beauty and joy of computing" this semester.
