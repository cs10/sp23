Hey there! :) I’m a rising junior studying CS, CogSci, and Data Sci., and this is my third time teaching CS-10. As someone who started out with little programming experience, I believe that CS at Berkeley can be a challenging, yet immensely rewarding experience. My primary goal this semester is to help students discover and come to appreciate the remarkable beauty of problem solving- for which, Computer Science is an indispensable tool!
