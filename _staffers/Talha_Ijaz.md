Hello Everyone! I am a freshman studying CS, Applied Maths, and Data Science. It's my first time being part of the CS 10 Community. I took this course last semester and I can assure each and everyone of you that it will not only prepare you for further CS courses, but will also give you a set of skills that will help you succeed in various courses. So be prepared for a fun yet challenging course :)
