Hi! My name is Sophie and I'm a second year studying CogSci and Data Science. This is my second time as a CS10 AI, and I'm so excited to be helping out again this semester. I really enjoyed my time in CS10, and I'm looking forward to giving the same experience to all of the students! Hope to see you all in lab! :)
