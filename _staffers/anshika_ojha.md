Hi! I'm a Freshman intented to major in Business Administrations and Computer Science. I'm super excited to help our with CS10 because it fueled my interest in the technology field. I started with no experience and CS10 build my confidence to take CS61A and I'm ready for the challenge! My goal this semester is to work through CS10 with students and help them build their confidence and get them interested in the tech field as well as share my CS61A experience with students who are interested in hearing how it's going.
