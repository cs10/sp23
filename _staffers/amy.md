Hi! I'm a third year majoring in Data Science. I took CS10 Spring of 2021, back when I had no coding experience whatsoever. This class became one of my favorites and I've been on course staff as an AI ever since. I hope to help as best as I can! A few things about me: I'm from SoCal, I love listening to Bad Bunny, I like horror movies, and I like taking walks around my neighborhood.
