Hello! I'm Aanvi, from Calcutta, India, a freshman double majoring in CompSci and Data Science. I'm involved in DS research this semester and am also a part of the game theory group led by Prof Garcia. Outside of academics, I'm always down for a game of ping pong. I'm excited to be an AI for CS10 this semester and get to know you all!
