Hi there!!! Iâ€™m Vianna and I am a first year interested in computer science and applied math. Taking CS10 during my first semester at Cal was my introduction to programming. I absolutely fell in love with the course and can't wait to help other students discover the beauty and joy that is computing. Outside of school I like baking, dancing, listening to all kinds of music, and watching Asian dramas :)
