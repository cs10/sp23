Hi! I’m a sophomore studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I took CS 10 in Fall'21 and was an AI in Spring'21. This is my second time being a reader so I’m very excited! CS 10 was one of my favorite courses, so I hope everyone will have fun while taking it! In my free time I like reading (especially fantasy), sewing and traveling :)
