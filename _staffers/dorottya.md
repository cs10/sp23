Hi! I’m a sophomore studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I took CS 10 last fall and was an AI last spring. This is my first time being a reader so I’m very excited! CS 10 was one of my favorite courses, so I hope everyone will have fun while taking it! In my free time I like reading (especially fantasy), sewing and traveling :)
