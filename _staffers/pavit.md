Hey everyone! 
My name is Pavit and I’m a sophomore studying CS. In my free time I like to play the guitar, follow the Premier League, and hang out with friends. I think CS 10 is a super cool intro to CS and I’m really excited to be helping you guys out as a returning AI this semester. Shoot me an email - I’m always down to grab coffee!
