Hi everyone! I'm Kait, a sophomore studying data science and computer science. This is my first time being an AI in cs10 so I'm excited to work with all of you! Before taking cs10 my first semester at Cal, I had zero programming experience. After taking this course, I am confident I want to puruse this field throughout my next couple of years and I can definitely say that it has opened my eyes to the beauty of programming :) In my free time, I love to try new coffee shops, listen to music, dance, and travel to new places.
