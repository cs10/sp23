Hi everyone! My name is Nicole, and I am a first-year intending to major in CS. I took CS10 last semester and I really enjoyed it! As someone who was new to programming, CS10 was extremely helpful and taught me a lot. I hope you all enjoy this class as much as I did, and please don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to being an AI this semester, and to be able to help in any way that I can :)
