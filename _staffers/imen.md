Hey hey hey!!! It's going to be a blast getting to know you all! (': \
\
I'm in my second year studying EECS & (just started pursuing) Cognitive Science, and this will be my third time on staff! My technical interests lie in integrations of human cognitive development research in robotics and machine learning, and I'm growing to love the theory and mathematics behind quantitative big data processes. I came to Cal with no programming experience, and since my first semester here, CS 10 continues to be the community that keeps me going. You can catch me playing volleyball or getting lost in town during my free time (I have no sense of direction!)
