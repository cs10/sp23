Hey everyone! It's going to be a blast getting to know you all! (': I'm in my second year at Cal studying EECS, and this will be my second time teaching CS 10! As cool as software may be, I'm looking forward to delving more into hardware this semester, through circuit design and some of my own personal explorations with e-textiles and intersections of EE with materials science. I came to Cal with no programming experience, and since my first semester here, CS 10 continues to be the community that keeps me going. You can catch me playing volleyball or getting lost in town during my free time (I have no sense of direction!)
