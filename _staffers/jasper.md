Hi everyone! I am a fourth year majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I took CS10 way back in my first semester here at Cal and I can honestly say it's the best class I've taken. Outside of school I love to watch soccer (Come on You Gunners!), play tennis, and travel with my family. I hope you enjoy CS10 as much as I did!
