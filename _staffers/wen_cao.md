Hi everyone! I'm Wen and I'm a freshman interested in Pure Math, Computer Science, and Mechanical Engineering. This is my second semester of college and my first time AIing CS10! I took CS10 last semester and had tons of joy. I'm a food lover and a big fan of ketchup. I also like running marathons and watching soccer games. Can't wait to see you all this semester:))))
