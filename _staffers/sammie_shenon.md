Hi! Iâ€™m a sophomore studying Computer Science with a minor in French. I took CS10 Fall 2021 and I loved the course and learned a ton! It was a great entry into the world of Computer Science and made me much more confident going into later Berkeley CS courses. In my free time I love to watch movies, read, get outdoors, and try new food spots. I look forward to being an AI again this semester!
