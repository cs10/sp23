Hiiii! I’m Eric and I’m a rising sophomore studying EECS. I took CS10 my first semester at Cal and have been an AI in my second, and I had a chance to be a reader over the summer. I'm very excited to be a reader for a second time for CS10! I enjoy reading, writing stories, finding new music, walking, and playing games. Hope you guys have a great time this fall!
