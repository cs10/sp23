Hello everyone! My name is Aadip and I'm a freshman studying computer science and data science. I took CS 10 in my first semester at Berkeley and it was a very rewarding experience. I'm thrilled to return this semester as an Academic Intern to be able to share my knowledge and passion in computer science with you all. Outside of class, I love to stay active and I enjoy working out, playing basketball, and hanging out with friends. I look forward to meeting you all!
