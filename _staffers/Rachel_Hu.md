Hi, I'm Rachel and I'm a current Freshman studying computer science! I am excited to be an academic intern for CS-10. Although I have had some previous experience in web and iOS development through personal projects, CS-10 was my first official computer science class I have ever taken! As I believe coding is a catalyst for social change, I am excited to help teach computer science to all.
