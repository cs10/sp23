Hello! My name is Mihir and I am a second year Computer Science major and Data Science minor! I am really looking forward to this amazing semester and I hope you are too! It's gonna be great! Two truths and 1 lie: I've been to New York, I've never taken CS 10, I've lived in the Bay Area for over 15 years.
