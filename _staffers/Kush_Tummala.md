Hey! I'm a freshman intending to study Computer Science, and this is my first time teaching CS-10. I believe that CS-10 can be a challenging class (as I took it my first semester), but it is highly rewarding and that is why I want to continue my journey in this class. My primary goal this semester is to help students while simultaneously solidifying my coding experience.
