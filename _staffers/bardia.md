Wsp! Iâ€™m a first year studying CS and Econ. This is my first time on CS10 coursestaff, and I could not be more excited to meet all of you. I took CS10 Fall 2022 and loved it. You learn not only the fundamentals and intuition of great programmers, but many fascinating and useful paradigms that exist within the realm of Computer Science. I hope I can help many students this semester in solving puzzles and unearth the beauty of Computer Science. Ad Astra!
