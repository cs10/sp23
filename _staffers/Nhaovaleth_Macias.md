hello! I am a current sophomore majoring in Molecular and Cellular Biology with a minor in CS. I took CS10 my spring semester of my freshman year, so I am extremeley excited to be helping out with the course for the first time! I understand the struggles of such an intense subject as someone who came into college with no knowledge of CS, so this semester I hope to become a resource for everyone in their journey through CS10. I hope that you all are in love with CS10 and Imm Thai just as much as I am by the end of the semester, can't wait to work with everyone :)
