Hello there! I'm a sophomore studying Microbial Biology and Data Science. This is my first time teaching CS-10 :) Last year I took CS-10 with no previous coding experience. I am so grateful for this course because it helped me find my passion for CS and choose to minor in Data Science. Studying CS at UC Berkeley can feel intimidating, however I hope that with the help of peers and staff, students can find rewarding experiences in this course!
