Hi! I am a freshman intending to major in Physics and CS, and this is my first-time AI-ing CS 10. I took the course last semester, inspiring me to pursue CS as my second major. I joined the class with ZERO experience in coding, and I left the class with enough skills to start my CS journey here at Cal. I hope to support you throughout the course!
