Hey there! :) I'm a junior studying CS, Cognitive Science, and Data Science. This is my sixth time on course staff at Cal, fourth time teaching and third time as Head-TA for CS-10.\

As someone who started out with little programming experience, I believe that CS at Berkeley can be a challenging, yet immensely rewarding experience. My primary goal this semester is to help students discover and come to appreciate the remarkable beauty of problem solving- for which, Computer Science is an indispensable tool!\
